## Elasticity calcualtions

Functionality for using data to calculate elasticity of materials

### Setup

Install Python (suggested 3.10+)

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

Run the following command from the main directory (with the virtual environment active if applicable)
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running

Currently only handles 1 file at a time, which will be improved later.
Go to main.py and edit the lines that say "input_file_name = ..." and "output_file_name = ..." to your desired values, then just run main.py.
